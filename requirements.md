# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a QLoRA-based fine-tuning workflow for medical language models using Unsloth's prebuilt notebooks in Google Colab. The system will enable efficient fine-tuning of large language models on medical datasets using 4-bit quantized low-rank adaptation techniques, with comprehensive monitoring and testing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want to load and prepare medical datasets for fine-tuning, so that I can train models on domain-specific clinical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a medical dataset is specified THEN the system SHALL load clinical Q&A pairs or similar medical text data
2. WHEN the dataset is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate the data format and structure
3. WHEN data preprocessing is initiated THEN the system SHALL tokenize the medical text using the appropriate tokenizer
4. IF the dataset contains invalid or corrupted entries THEN the system SHALL filter them out and report the count

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher with limited computational resources, I want to configure QLoRA with 4-bit quantization, so that I can fine-tune large models efficiently within Colab's memory constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN QLoRA configuration is initiated THEN the system SHALL set up 4-bit quantization parameters
2. WHEN a base model is selected THEN the system SHALL support Llama 3 or DeepSeek-R1 models
3. WHEN low-rank adaptation is configured THEN the system SHALL set appropriate rank and alpha parameters
4. WHEN memory optimization is enabled THEN the system SHALL configure gradient checkpointing and other memory-saving techniques

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a model trainer, I want to execute the fine-tuning workflow with proper monitoring, so that I can track training progress and resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is initiated THEN the system SHALL begin epoch-based training with the configured parameters
2. WHEN training is running THEN the system SHALL monitor and display memory usage in real-time
3. WHEN each epoch completes THEN the system SHALL log training loss and performance metrics
4. WHEN training encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
5. IF memory usage exceeds safe thresholds THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest optimizations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to save and manage fine-tuned adapters, so that I can preserve my trained models for future use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save the fine-tuned adapter weights
2. WHEN saving adapters THEN the system SHALL include metadata about training configuration and dataset
3. WHEN adapters are saved THEN the system SHALL provide options for local download or cloud storage
4. WHEN loading saved adapters THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility with the base model

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a model evaluator, I want to test the fine-tuned model on new medical queries, so that I can assess the quality and relevance of the model's responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is initiated THEN the system SHALL load the fine-tuned model with adapters
2. WHEN medical queries are provided THEN the system SHALL generate responses using the fine-tuned model
3. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL display both the query and model response
4. WHEN comparing responses THEN the system SHALL optionally show responses from the base model for comparison
5. IF the model generates inappropriate or unsafe content THEN the system SHALL flag and handle such responses appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Colab user, I want the workflow to be optimized for the Colab environment, so that I can run the entire process seamlessly within the notebook interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the notebook is opened THEN the system SHALL automatically install required dependencies including Unsloth
2. WHEN GPU resources are available THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and configure GPU usage
3. WHEN running in Colab THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators and status updates
4. WHEN session limits are approached THEN the system SHALL warn users and provide checkpoint saving options
5. IF Colab disconnects THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for resuming training from checkpoints
